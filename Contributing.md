### Akwaaba! 
Thanks for wanting to contribute. 
Please leave a star.

To contribute, follow the following guidelines, 

#### General Open Source Workflow
1. Fork the project into your github acccount
2. Clone the forked repo to your computer
3. Create a branch to add a new extension. Kindly create a branch name like so, add-nameofextension-yourfirstname for consistency
4. Add a web extension to the list in the [ReadMe](https://github.com/KarenEfereyan/extensions-4-every-developer/blob/master/README.md), Name of Extension should be a heading three or H3 (###)
5. Add a brief description of the extension
6. Add a features heading, with the main and interesting features of the extension. Do this using a list. 
7. Add an availability heading to indicate on what browsers the extension can be found with a direct download link for each of those.
8. Have an image ready which shows how the extension looks when in use and add it in using a link. The link text should be 'Here is how the extension looks'. All images should go into the Images folder.
9. If you are using Visual Studio Code IDE, preview your changes and ensure it looks good
10. ```git status``` to check the new changes
11. ```git add 'ReadMe.md' ``` which is the file that was updated and; ```git add images/[ScreenShot]``` which is the screenshot of the extension you are adding ( ```git add .``` gets this done easily, though).
12. ```git pull origin master``` to get all the new updates from the main repo. This ensures there are no merge conflicts
13. ```git commit -s -m "add name of extension" ```. The -s is the sign off flag and is extremely important. Please take note of it
14. ```git push origin name-of-your-branch``` 
15. Refresh your forked copy of the repo and you should automatically see your changes reflected
16. Open a pull request. Here is how your comparison should be. Compare from the new branch of your forked copy of the repo with the master branch of the 
original repo.
17. I check that all the guidelines are followed and your PR gets merged
