### Akwaaba! 
Thanks for wanting to contribute. 
Please leave a star.

To contribute, follow the following guidelines, 

#### General Open Source Workflow
1. Fork the project into your github acccount
2. Clone the forked repo to your computer
3. Create a branch to add a new extension. Kindly create a branch name like so, add-nameofextension-yourfirstname for consistency
4. Add a web extension to the list in the [ReadMe](https://github.com/KarenEfereyan/extensions-4-every-developer/blob/master/README.md) 
5. Add a brief description of the extension
6. Add a features heading, with the main and interesting features of the extension. Do this using a list. 
7. Add an availability heading to indicate on what browsers the extension can be found with a direct download link for each of those.
8. Have an image ready which shows how the extension looks when in use and add it in using a link. The link text should be 'Here is how the extension looks'
9. If you are using Visual Studio Code IDE, preview your changes and ensure it looks good
10. ```git status``` to check the new changes
11. ```git add 'ReadMe.md' ``` which is the file that was updated
12.``` git pull origin master``` to get all the new updates from the main repo. This ensures there are no merge conflicts
13. ```git commit -s -m "add name of extension" ```. The -s is the sign off flag and is extremely important. Please take note of it
14. ```git push origin name-of-your-branch``` 
15. Refresh your forked copy of the repo and you should automatically see your changes reflected
16. Open a pull request. Here is how your comparison should be. Compare from the new branch of your forked copy of the repo with the master branch of the 
original repo.
17. I check that all the guidelines are followed and your PR gets merged
